# What is Kengin?
Kengin is a data-driven, distributed game engine. It's primary use case is highly connected worlds (e.g. metaverse and large multi-player worlds)

It's primary language is Rust.

# Why use Kengin?
The focus of Kengin is optimising the data flow across the whole game engine.

Kengin is designed as a distributed system which allows:
- scaling parts of the system independently, with many benefits like lower server costs
- no overhead for parts of the system you don't use which brings runtime performance benefits and smaller distributions
- distribution of game worlds over cloud, edge servers and clients letting you create large, responsive worlds

# Why Rust?
Each language has it's own strengths, but we chose Rust because:
- it has very little runtime overhead
- comparable performance to other low level languages (C and C++)
- it memory safe
- it supports many targets (e.g. WASM)
- it has a great package manager (Cargo) which helps with a loosely coupled project
- it's a well designed language with a great community

# When can I use Kengin
Kengin is undergoing development. The initial focus is on creating an incrediably efficient underlying data flow.

We anticipate the initial beta release to go public in Autumn 2021. Please check back often for updates!
